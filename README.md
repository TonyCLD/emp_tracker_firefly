This is my employee Tracker project.  
It has all of the database searching functionality, but I was unable to get the adding to the database to show up. I could see my additions in MySQL workbench, 
but I was unable to get them to show up in the terminal. I'm hoping to add that functionality back once I get caught up on homework.
